# Analyzing Cell Migration Velocity from PyScratch outputs

## 1. Download PyScratch

To install PyScratch, you can `git clone https://bitbucket.org/vladgaal/pyscratch_public/src/master/`

Watch a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUlg_DkeiQg) on how to install PyScratch.

## 2. Analyze you images, well by well

Watch a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUlg_DkeiQg) on how to analyze your data using Pyscratch.

## 3. Prepare your inputs for using the Jupyter notebooks and Requirements

Requirements are
- **Anaconda or miniconda**: Install anaconda or miniconda from their website, so you have Python 3 and Jupyter notebook already configured.
- **Layout.csv**: Have a layout csv file with columns as: Wells, Treatments, and Cell.
- **Well_data.csv**: Have output files from PyScratch, with your Well name (same as you have on Layout.csv)

## 4. Example folder

On Example folder, you find many Well_data.csv files, a layout file, and a test_fig.tif required to measure your image's specifications. 
On Example/output, you have the plots for each well after analysis, and a Results.csv contaning the velocity's measurements.
